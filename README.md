# Simon

Simon is a classic memory game first launched at Studio 54 in 1978. This groovy pop culture symbol has been deployed as a web-based game. The program displays a randomized sequence of illuminated colors and the player's goal is to repeat the sequence by clicking the correct color buttons on the gameboard to win and advance to the next level.

## Getting Started
To get started, click the play button and the game launches.

The gameboard displays a sequence of random illuminated colors.
